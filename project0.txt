---------------------------------------------------------

Note: You should follow Dr. Finkel's checklist for good programming:
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/checklist.html

---------------------------------------------------------

- You are to implement a simple web page to convert units of measurement.

- Your web page must be implemented on the www.cs.uky.edu webserver.

- Your web page must reside at the following URL:
	http://www.cs.uky.edu/~YOURUSERID/CS316/convert.html

- Your CGI program must reside at the following URL:
	http://www.cs.uky.edu/~YOURUSERID/CS316/convert_units.cgi

- Your HTML file should:
	- use HTML forms to ask the user for a number, a unit, and a new
	  unit, like:   77, miles, kilometers.
	- either allow the user to type the units, or use a select input
	  or by radio type, etc.
	- use the GET method and send the user input via the ACTION attribute
	  to your CGI program (see below).

- Your CGI program should:
	- be written in perl, python, ruby, or C/C++.
	- should never abort due to incorrect user input.
	- should validate units being converted.
	- should perform the required arithmetic to convert the value the
	  user input to the new units.
	- return the new value and units back to the user or an appropriate
	  error message.
	- NOT call any external URLs from within the program.
	- be properly documented.
	

Your HTML/CGI files should handle the following units:

kilometers, meters, miles, feet
celsius, fahrenheit, kelvin
hours, minutes, seconds, days


What you are required to turn in your ZIP archive:

1. A file named "convert.html".
2. A file named "convert_units.cgi", or the source code if C/C++.
